### apps that I use regularly
Koreader: kinda cool but it's optimized for eink, but the interface but find the interface displeasing. technically it's a more powerful app, and it's also open source. It's good for any E-ink device 

aio-launcher: my fav launcher. The reason I changed the onyx launcher, because it's ugly (im not kidding )

ابجد: it's cool but u must subscribe to read some books, There is all kinds of books and also translated 
Syncthing: to sync my files across my laptops and iPad, Its pretty good tho
